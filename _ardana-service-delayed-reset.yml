# During the install process, ardana-service is run in an unsecured fashion
# because some services, such as keystone, is not yet available.
# This playbook is run at the end of the install process (site.yml) to switch
# ardana-service to a secured configuration running with keystone enabled.
# The asynchronous 60 second delay is needed so site.yml can complete, 
# allowing ardana-service to tell the UI it is done with the install.
# Once ardana-service is restarted, the UI is no longer able to communicate
# to ardana-service.
# Subsequent runs of this playbook will always fail because ardana-service
# requires keystone authentication to use its API.  ignore_errors: yes will
# allow site.yml to complete.
